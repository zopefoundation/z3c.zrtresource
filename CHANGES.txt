1.3.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Use new ``zope.browserresource`` package instead of ``zope.app.publisher``,
  as the resources mechanism was moved there to reduce dependencies.

- Register ZRTFileResourceFactory as a resource factory with name "zrt" in
  package's configure.zcml. This makes ZRT resources created automatically
  when using ``browser:resource`` directive for files with "zrt" extensions.
  It will also make *.zrt files inside resourse directories a ZRTFileResource.

- Get rid of ``zope.app.testing`` test dependency.

- Remove unused SETUP.CFG and z3c.zrtresource-meta.zcml files.
